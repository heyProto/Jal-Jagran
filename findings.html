                                    <p>Some middle-aged men ask them to ‘go more dirty’ with their jokes, some older uncles
                                        tell them ‘not to swear’. While men are found funny, women comic artistes are called
                                        ‘bold’. While the media covers the male artists’ achievements, the women artistes
                                        are only asked for comments related to their gender. No wonder when in January this
                                        year, Amazon Prime announced that it will stream content featuring 14 top India stand-up
                                        comics, there was not one woman in it. Hear it all from comic veterans Radhika Vaz,
                                        Neeti Palta and Kaneez Surka on the sexism, bro-code, corporate culture and Indian
                                        cultural hypocrisy. And they say it in style without mincing words.</p>
                                    <p>Author of the brilliant ‘Unladylike’, Radhika is one comedian who doesn’t shy away from
                                        talking about her body. She recently won the Gotham Award in New York for her web
                                        series “Shugs &amp; Fats”. The web series is a comic take on the lives of two women
                                        who don the hijab and go about their daily lives. Vaz has not only mastered feminism
                                        but made it all-inclusive.</p>

                                <p>Actually, I think when women go into anything that they’re passionate about, they don’t think
                                    about being women. You just go, we want to do this job and we don’t think about this
                                    until much, much later. I have to say when I started comedy a long time ago, I was very
                                    lucky because first of all, I didn’t start as a stand up comedian. I was an improviser
                                    and a lot of the coaches and other really fantastic improvisers, that I had the pleasure
                                    of working with, were all women. So I was very inspired. I didn’t think for a minute
                                    that it was a problem. One of the things I still believe is that comedy really is for
                                    women. I mean I do think we are funnier. You know what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
                                    and funnier. And I think women have had to put up with that much more than men. So we
                                    are stronger, we are funnier. I also think that it’s interesting how you don’t have to
                                    be young, or thin or good looking. It’s one of those jobs like being a doctor. You literally
                                    don’t need to be pretty, or thin or young. You can be older, you can be not attractive
                                    by you know the standards of the world that are actually set up exclusively for women.
                                    Because we live in a world of patriarchy and misogyny.</p>

                                    <p>Yeah, of course. I mean you guys call me up and ask me about being a female comedian.
                                        I mean I wish we could change this. Honestly, if the media stopped doing it. (laughs)
                                        I don’t mind being called a woman comedian. It shouldn’t be a big deal one way or
                                        another. But I do believe that what’s been happening a lot is that we get approached
                                        a lot by journalists about being a woman in comedy. We rarely get approached by journalists
                                        to cover our achievements. Rarely. If you really want to know where the problems
                                        are, I would highly recommend you look into maybe where you guys are also coming
                                        from. The moment a guy does it, everyone is covering it.

                                    <p>My view of men, who have reached a certain level regardless of what job they are doing,
                                        is that they will typically only promote women, who they know, are not of their level.
                                        It takes a very big man, see it takes a very big person firstly to promote someone
                                        of their level. Because you are, that is your competition. So you have to literally
                                        be that kind of person who is looking at the industry at large, and your own tiny
                                        little di*k.. You have to be a visionary. And so, when you are promoting women or
                                        men who are not of your level, you’re not that person. If you look across the board
                                        of most businesses, you will rarely find men promoting women. You will rarely find

                                        seen”, “oh she’s so amazing”, she’s so clever, she’s the best banker we have, but
                                        you don’t often see them doing that for women of their level and I feel like that’s
                                        something very deep in men that they can’t handle competition from women. They don’t
                                        mind promoting you so long as you’re beneath them. But the moment you’re of their
                                        level or above them, they know it. And they don’t want anything to do with you, because
                                        you are going to show them; and this is not a comedy thing, I just want to be very
                                        clear about that. This is my opinion of men in general.</p>

                                    <h2>Of course, these are the things we all experience daily at our respective workplaces.</h2>
                                    <p>Correct! My thing is this bro-code can only be as powerful as we let it be and I honestly
                                        think that if women from across different industries, if we all start to be very
                                        clear that we are all supporting each other and no one else, and not be ashamed of
                                        it. I’m still to see 50 per cent representation of women. We have not done our job
                                        as feminists. Backing out just because 2-3 women are getting a chance, our job is
                                        not complete. I think, a lot of times, we are made to feel almost like we are the
                                        sexist [ones] for saying that we will only promote women. How are we sexist? Women
                                        are so far behind that if you only promote women for the next 100 years, we still
                                        won’t defeat patriarchy.</p>
                                    <p>I love my comedy brothers but they don’t need me. Women need support and I feel like
                                        if I can only support X number of people then why would I be trying to support anyone
                                        else? And it is not sexist until we have 50 percent representation.</p>
                                    <p>We use comedy as a specific example but I don’t feel this is only a comedy problem but
                                        this is a cultural issue and we can’t expect comedians to have higher standards.
                                        I was pretty surprised when that Arunabh Kumar sexual harassment case and everyone
                                        was like ‘haw, this is so shocking’. I am just like, ‘Really? Because the boys are
                                        no longer wearing cringy bell bottoms?’</p>
                                    <p>Maybe the shock comes from the content that they sell, you know. A lot of feminist content
                                        is now coming up and a lot of these men are at the forefront of it.</p>
                                    <p>Because that’s what is selling right now. Because there are male comedians who make clips
                                        about feminism and then you watch them saying things like some women are feminazi.
                                        Like, are you kidding me?</p>

                                        Neeti is indeed a ‘bold’ comedian, a phrase she loves to hate. She brought the female
                                        perspective to Indian comedy long before feminist videos and web series came that
                                        now populate the internet. She was the first Indian comic to perform at the Melbourne

                                    <p>A lot of it is a reflection because a lot of what I speak on stage is stuff that I have
                                        experienced about. I honestly had a good childhood. I had no trauma per se and my
                                        parents pretty much brought my brother and me up equally. But society would step
                                        in and not let them do that equally. I think all of us grow up with those realities.
                                        I used to take DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) bus to get to college and I have
                                        experienced the experiences of an Indian woman. When I started to do comedy, suddenly,
                                        all this stuff started coming out of me. And I’m like, kahan se aa raha hai,(where
                                        is it coming from?). I have had a good life. Where is all this angst coming from?
                                        Clearly it has all been stored inside.</p>

                                        God bless them. Then I pointed out, you don’t have to specifically mention my gender.

                                        do everything to encourage female artists but I am against the idea of an all female

                                        There are 16, 17, 20 people vying for spots, if you are good, you will get it. You
                                        will be rejected once, twice. Being a stand up, you have to be able to face rejection,

                                    <p>There is that thing going around, ‘oh! female comedians will only talk about their boobs,
                                        bras, menstruation.’ If guys can talk about their boyfriends and the size of their
                                        juniors, then why can’t we talk about what we go through? This is something I’ve
                                        actually said. What we do is called chick comedy. What they do is not called d*ck
                                        comedy. It’s not fair. They have actually made us conscious of that fact now that
                                        ‘oh! they’re only going to be talking about their period.’ Which is not true. We
                                        talk about everything we experience. If periods is one of them, then so be it, man.</p>

                                    <p>I have a joke about being middle class, and I say that is why my grandmother hates my
                                        underwear because she is like, yeh kaisa duster banega, (What kind of a duster it
                                        will become?) I’m like that is why Indian households prefer male children because
                                        their underwear makes better dusters. I am making a point, connecting different dots.
                                        I talk about how women expected to have children and the whole pressure is on women.
                                        How women are only asked, good news kab hai. (When will we hear the good news?) I
                                        have brought all this up and a lot of times women have come up to me and said you’re

                                    <p>A lot of older people are very kicked by the comedy. Because they’re also like, ‘Finally!
                                        smart comedy. She is at least making a point.’ But I have also had people judging
                                        me. Like when you are on a line up with two guys and everyone’s been funny, but more
                                        often than not people will pass up the file and tell the guys you were really funny

                                    <p>I will always be equated with bold. And I ask bold thi, but funny thi? (Bold is fine
                                        but was I funny?) Like aapko hassi aayi? (Did it make you laugh?) Then it gets irritating
                                        that why is there a different adjective for me. Either you get bold or you get a
                                        comment on your looks. And I’m still like was I funny or not? Ticket meri shakal
                                        dekhne ke liye li thi? (Did you buy the ticket to look at my face?) It drives me
                                        nuts.

                                    <p>Radhika Vaz does, she talks about her vagina, pussy, periods. The way that she does,
                                        she doesn’t come across as crass. There’s a point to it but no soft pressure. In
                                        fact, a lot of times, corporates reach out to us, they think female comedian will
                                        be clean. I remember doing a 45 minute show, it was very well received. In the end,
                                        I did one bit about Punjabi weddings where I talk about Punjabis. I did a sentence
                                        about a character, and it swears. One uncleji, comes and says, ‘beta, tum gaali mat
                                        diya karo, achha nahi lagta.’ (Child, please dont swear. It is not nice) And I’m
                                        like 45 mins mein ek gaali yaad aaye. Mere aage peeche jo comedians aaye the unhone
                                        maa behen aunty uncle sabki leli, usse fark nahi pada aapko, meri ek gaali yaad hai.
                                        Uncle aapke dimag mein sirf ek hi gaali kyun thi.(I replied that in a 45 minute show
                                        all that you choose to remember is a swear word. All the male performers before and
                                        after me swore but all you remember that a woman used a swear word) He didn’t know
                                        how to react to that.</p>
                                    <p>Then you hear the sound of the Indian value judgment, which is ‘sssssh, tch tch tch.’.
                                        Conversely, there is pressure if you do private parties. They say, ‘go dirty, go
                                        dirty.’ I say, ‘Dude, tu pole dance manga lena. kya chaah raha hai?’ (Dude, why dont
                                        you call a pole dancer?) In one of the Rotary shows, the whole proceedings were preceded
                                        by the National Anthem. Everyone stood up. Then they called me on the stage and a
                                        woman whispered to me on stage, ‘go dirty, go naughty’. I was like I am not here
                                        to titillate old men. This lady at the back kept doing this. Action. So, I finally
                                        said, ‘You really should watch some porn. I can play it in the background if my jokes
                                        aren’t funny.’ They think it’d be cool to hear dirty jokes from a female, it will
                                        be titillating.</p>

                                    <h2>What kind of challenges did you face as a female comedian?</h2>
                                    <p>Improvisation came really easy to me. I think I had a natural talent for improvisations
                                        that I did not have for stand up comedy. Initially, I was with a group with a very
                                        strong male energy. They were aggressive and loud. Thatis not a good or bad thing
                                        but I just found it very hard to compete with that energy on stage. I found myself
                                        too loud and shouting to try to compete with them. Female energy is a little more
                                        subtle, I believe, on stage. That kind of disappeared as my confidence in my skill
                                        grew. I went to the US to learn more improvised comedy. I think people in the comedy
                                        circle appreciated that I went outside to learn. Like ‘this is something she is taking
                                        seriously.’ I saw myself growing confident in my skill. Then I started with my improvising
                                        in 2013 with Kenny, Abish, Kanan. It was a beautiful group and the chemistry just
                                        worked. As a group, they were not aggressive, they were very giving. They are more
                                        on the fun side. With that, I stopped seeing myself as a female and started seeing
                                        myself as someone who knows improvisation in India. My confidence came from there.
                                        I didn’t have to compete with a male energy. I’m confident in my skill. Now, it doesn’t
                                        matter if I’m black or white or female or male.</p>

                                    <p>The lovely thing about improvisation is that because it’s on the spot, people are judging
                                        less. And they are also curious to know what’s going to happen next. The judgements
                                        kind of fall aside. They are more involved in the process. I’ve never found the audience
                                        judging me. I play characters that are gender neutral, like a librarian, a doctor.
                                        I play male parts, female part – because if I don’t pay attention to that, then the
                                        audience doesn’t either.</p>

                                    <p>That’s the thing with sex. As a comedian, that’s the first area you explore. You are
                                        given this voice in public, bring jokes to them. Sex is something all of us have
                                        grown up with seeing a taboo. You can’t talk about it. Finally, when you have the
                                        freedom to talk about it, people really embrace it. They’re like, ‘Ah, I get to say
                                        boobs, balls, on stage. It is a liberating feeling.’ It’s such a basic human activity.
                                        It is the first thing that we go through as comedians. Explore sexuality and what
                                        sex is to us. I know there is a lot of opinion on sexual content but I think it is
                                        also a good thing because of the kind of society we live in.

                                        together. It is too small to start competing just yet. It’ is only 120 of us in the
                                        whole country. But I think, there is a bit of a partition in the comedy scene already
                                        starting but nothing that is really affecting the scene.</p>

                                    <p>There are certain comedians that work together more. I don’t think it is a negative partition.
                                        People are just like, ’I click more with this kind of area.’ I think it is more like
                                        these people have more my kind of vibe.</p>

                                    <p>I just hired someone, the other day. I have got an editor who I pay and who works with
                                        me for my videos. I’m hiring a writer – one of the female open mic-ers, for helping
                                        me write stuff. In my own way, I’m building my own work. Because I do need all this
                                        help, for my content. I don’t know editing and I need someone to help me write because
                                        I’m doing so much now. Sumukhi is also doing the same thing, you know, hire some
                                        writers, have a team to shoot her videos. We are all building our small little enterprises.
                                        It just has five people instead of 35. It’s happening naturally. I didn’t think,
                                        ‘oh, I need to start something.’ It’s happening in a very organic way. As of now,
                                        it is working like ‘ I’d like to hire you and here’s a salary.’ Let’s see how this
                                        works out.</p>

                                        up of 14 male comedians?</h2>
                                    <p>I’ll tell you the exact reason. OML, the managing company, manages around 20 comedians.
                                        They have three women on their roster- Mallika Dua, Sumukhi Suresh and me. OML and
                                        Amazon entered into a discussion about producing content for Amazon. OML told Amazon
                                        saying we want to do some content on your channel. So Amazon said let’s do some stand
                                        up specials. OML was like, ‘Great. So we’ll just go back to our office and see who
                                        is interested.’ Now, Mallika doesn’t do stand up, I barely do stand up and Sumukhi
                                        is working on her stand up. None of the girls had a one hour special. When they asked
                                        us, we were like, ‘we can’t do anything.’ I know it is a big deal but it really was
                                        just a business meeting. And I guess Amazon could have taken it on themselves that
                                        we need to go outside and hire and approach female comedians. But it is their deal
                                        with OML. I know we totally would have gotten it. We would have totally gotten it
                                        if we had a one hour special ready.</p>
                                    <p>Yeah, but like you said, Amazon could have gotten out of their way to balance this line
                                        up.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I guess they forgot to think about that because they were just dealing with one company.
                                        So, yeah, maybe, and then they got the backlash. So, maybe after this, they will
                                        approach these female comedians. There are females with a one hour- Neeti, Radhika,
                                        Aditi, they have one hour specials. Mallika, Sumukhi and I were asked but we didn’t
                                        have anything.</p>

                                    <h2>There are these cliques, but do you think there is a bro-code especially among male comedians?</h2>
                                    <p>What is this bro-code, I’ve never been asked but suddenly now everyone is asking me about
                                        this! Honestly for me, I feel very comfortable to speak to the boys about anything.
                                        If I feel uncomfortable about anything, I say it and it’s taken care of. I don’t
                                        feel disrespected by my male counterparts or I don’t feel less than them, they respect
                                        me for the work I do. I am not a part of these collectives, and so for me, the bro-code
                                        really doesn’t exist. If someone else feels like that, sure but as for Kaneez Surka,
                                        no.

                                    <p>When I’ve been uncomfortable I’ve said it. I’m not worried about being cool anymore.
                                        I am not interested in being the cool chick who plays video games and drinks beer
                                        with the boys. Like, my focus really is on my career so I am not trying to get in
                                        with a cool gang. Like I kind of already feel like a dadi of the whole comedy scene,
                                        I’ve been here too long. But I would like to think that if some girl has an issue,
                                        if something came up, I would not say why the f*ck did you say that he did that.
                                        Again, I’m not the law so I can’t make judgements. But I would like them to know,
                                        that they can come to me. Maybe, I should go and tell them that they are free to
                                        talk to me. Of course, there is a fear [of losing on your career], there is a fear
                                        for men as well. I don’t fear losing too much right now, but I can imagine those
                                        who just joined not being able to voice their opinion, thinking I will never get
                                        another sketch, I’ll never get another gig, you know.</p>
